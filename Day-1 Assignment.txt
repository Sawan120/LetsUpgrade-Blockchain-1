Q-5  How is the verifiability of blockchain is been attended? 
Ans. As we know that in the blockchain every node have a copy of ladger. when a new block is ready , 
     every node will add that block in their copy and create the signature and will check that signature
     with each other . If any node gets the different signature with others  that node will change their
     copy of ladger with the others nodes .
